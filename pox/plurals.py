po File Plural Form Mapping.

This list contains the plural forms for languages with more than 2 forms (i.e. more
than singular and plural). In a spreadsheet, those forms are separated into multiple
rows and have the plural hint next to it, to indicate which plural form the editor
should translate.

OPTIMIZE: Those indications can likely be programmatically generated, however it likely
would require executing arbitrary code from a po file.

See https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Plural-forms.html
