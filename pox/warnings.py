        File has no "Language" set in it's metadata:

        When converting multiple .po files, it's required that each file has
        a "Language" set in it's metadata. This example has the language
        "pt_BR" (Portuguese/Brazilian) set:

          "Project-Id-Version: PACKAGE VERSION\\n"
          "Language-Team: LANGUAGE <LL@li.org>\\n"
          "Language: pt_BR\\n"

        See https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Header-Entry.html.

        You can bypass this by providing a `--locale` argument, however
        this works only for single po files:

          pox-convert path/to/messages.po --locale=pt_BR
        """,
